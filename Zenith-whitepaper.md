# **Zenith: Invoice Financing Marketplace on Stellar**

## **1\. Executive Summary**

**Zenith is a decentralized invoice financing platform that leverages Stellar's blockchain infrastructure and Soroban smart contracts to help Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), freelancers, and gig workers access immediate liquidity by tokenizing their verified, unpaid invoices. The project introduces a liquidity pool model to streamline the funding process, improve scalability, and reduce risk. It also integrates a range of use cases — from ESG-linked invoices to micro-financing for the gig economy — uniquely enabled by Stellar's low fees, fiat anchors, and compliance tooling.**

---

## **2\. Problem Statement**

**SMEs and freelancers worldwide face significant delays in invoice payments — often waiting 30 to 90 days or more. This creates cash flow bottlenecks that hinder growth and reduce operational flexibility. Traditional invoice factoring is costly, centralized, and excludes smaller actors and those in emerging markets. The lack of transparency, high intermediary fees, and limited accessibility present a critical bottleneck to financial inclusion and economic efficiency.**

---

## **3\. Solution Overview**

**Zenith allows businesses to tokenize unpaid invoices using Soroban smart contracts. These tokenized invoices are funded through a decentralized liquidity pool. Upon repayment, the smart contracts automatically handle settlement and token burning. The platform supports fiat on/off-ramping via Stellar anchors, ensuring usability for both crypto-native and non-crypto users.**

**Key Features:**

* **Tokenization of invoices as non-fungible tokens (NFTs)**

* **Decentralized liquidity pool for passive investor funding**

* **Smart contract-driven repayment and trust score system**

* **Fiat payouts via Stellar anchor network**

---

## **4\. Technology Stack**

* **Blockchain: Stellar**

* **Smart Contracts: Soroban (WASM-based)**

* **Stablecoin Infrastructure: USDC, EURC, and local currency anchors**

* **Identity & Compliance: SEP-24, SEP-38, KYC-integrated onboarding**

* **Front-End: Web interface (React \+ Stellar SDK)**

---

## **5\. How It Works**

### **5.1 Invoice Submission & Verification**

* **Business uploads invoice metadata (amount, due date, customer, etc.)**

* **Platform verifies legitimacy through integrations (e.g., QuickBooks, Stripe) or manual validation**

### **5.2 Tokenization**

* **A Soroban smart contract mints an NFT representing the invoice**

* **Metadata includes due date, value, originator ID, and repayment terms**

### **5.3 Liquidity Pool Model**

* **Investors deposit stablecoins into a pool and receive LP tokens**

* **Pool automatically funds approved invoices based on availability and risk score**

* **Businesses receive upfront liquidity at a discount (e.g., 95% of face value)**

### **5.4 Repayment & Settlement**

* **Customer pays the business using a fiat on-ramp service (e.g., Moonpay, Ramp)**

* **Platform verifies incoming payment off-chain**

* **Once verified, the backend triggers smart contract to:**

  * **Mark invoice NFT as "done"**

  * **Burn or archive the NFT**

  * **Release returns to stakers**

### **5.5 Default Handling**

* **If unpaid past due date, late penalties accrue**

* **Businesses may be required to provide collateral**

* **Trust Score contract downgrades or blacklists defaulting businesses**

* **Modal Popup collects:**

  * **Stake Amount (max \= wallet USDC balance)**

  * **Stake Duration (in days)**

* **Backend validates input and initiates smart contract call**

* **Funds are locked and interest accrues over time**

**Formula for yield (suggested):**

**yield \= principal × (APR / 365\) × days\_staked**

**Example APR \= 10%**

### **6.4 Create Invoice**

  * **Is Recurring Invoice?**

  * **Collateral Type (optional)**

  * **ESG Flag (optional)**

  * **Preferred Payout Anchor (optional)**

    

* **Calculation logic:**

  * **Offer Amount \= `amount × (1 - discountRate)`**

**Suggested discount formula:**

**discountRate \= min(0.15, 0.02 \+ (days\_until\_deadline × 0.001))**

* **User clicks \`Create Invoice\` button.**  
* **Smart contract mints invoice NFT with metadata, created NFT\`s status is \`pending\` initially.**

* **User receives success message and is redirected to Main Page.**

### **6.5 See All Open Invoices**

* **Redirects to `openInvoices` page**

* **Shows all invoice NFTs with status \= “open”**

* **Click to view details:**

  * **Amount**

  * **Deadline**

  * **Expected Return**

  * **Associated Stake-to-Income Ratio:**

**Suggested formula for projected income:**

**income \= invoice\_amount × invoice\_rate × (user\_stake / total\_stake)**

### **6.6 Withdraw USDC**

* **Redirects to `withdraw` page**

* **Displays:**

  * **Original stake amount**

  * **Stake deadline**

  * **Current date**

* **If withdrawal is attempted before deadline, apply penalty:**

**Penalty formula (suggested):**

**penalty \= 0.10 × staked\_amount (if withdrawn early)**

* **Funds released via smart contract, adjusted for penalties**

### **6.7 Pay Invoice**

* **Redirects to `payInvoice` page.**

* **Lists invoices that are due for payment by the connected user.**

* **The user selects an invoice and is presented with two payment options:**

#### **Option 1: Pay with Connected Wallet (Freighter)**

* **User confirms the transaction to pay using their on-chain USDC balance.**

* **A Soroban smart contract handles:**

  * **Transfer of USDC to platform treasury**

  * **Validation of full amount**

  * **Marking invoice NFT as "done"**

  * **Burning/archiving the NFT**

  * **(If early) Cashback is issued**

  * **Smart contract is called to mark the invoice as “done”**

  * **NFT is burned or archived**

  * **(If early) Cashback is issued**

**Cashback logic:**

**if paid\_early:**

    **cashback \= invoice\_amount × 0.03 (example fixed %)**

### **6.8 My Invoices**

* **Redirected from header “My Invoices” button**

* **Lists user-owned NFT invoices with statuses:**

  * **“open”**

  * **“Done”**
